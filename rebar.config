% This is a configuration file of rebar3, so that Ceylan-Seaplus can better
% integrate in the current OTP ecosystem, despite its (more complex, probably
% more flexible) native build based on GNU make.
%
% If the name of this file is 'rebar.config', then it is a generated file,
% otherwise it is a template (located in conf/rebar.config.template), meant to
% be filled by information determined at build time or coming from
% GNUmakevars.inc.
%
% See the Myriad counterpart file (same name) for more explanations.


% Base layout obtained thanks to: 'rebar3 new lib seaplus', as Seaplus is a
% library OTP application (without supervision trees).

% To be taken into account, from the library root, through 'make
% rebar3-application' or 'make rebar3-release'.


% Settings for the 'default' profile follow.


% Depends on the Ceylan-Myriad OTP library application (Erlang implied):

% As a GIT-based dependency:
{deps, [ {myriad, {git, "git://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-Myriad",
					{branch, "master"}}} ] }.


% As an hex-package dependency:
%
% (works if the package uses a specific hook script, see
% hex-compile-hook-script.sh, to compensate for the GNUmake* root files that the
% package archive will not include at their location)
